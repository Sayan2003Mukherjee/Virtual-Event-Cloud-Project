I created a responsive virtual event hosting platform called CloudEvents using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, featuring a sleek interface with event listings and a contact form. The form collects user details like name, email, phone number, and message, which are automatically stored in a connected Google Sheet via a Google Apps Script Web App integration. The entire project is hosted on AWS S3 using static website hosting, making it accessible through a public URL. This setup allows seamless event showcasing and efficient contact data collection in a cloud-based environment.
